# AnimalPolymorphismDemo
A Java program that demonstrates polymorphism by creating an Animal class and two subclasses, Dog and Cat. The program showcases how an Animal reference can point to different types of animals (Dog or Cat) and calls their specific implementations of methods such as showSpecies() and makeSound().
